              <p>
                All importers must obtain <strong>local marine cargo insurance</strong> from a Kenya-licensed insurer.
                Customs clearance cannot proceed without this coverage.

              <li><strong>Finance Act, 2017:</strong> Modified Marine Insurance Act, Section 16A - mandates persons with interest in
              marine cargo to secure insurance from a locally licensed insurer</li>

              As a cargo consolidator, you must ensure all consolidated shipments have proper marine cargo insurance from
              Kenyan-licensed insurers. This is now a prerequisite for customs clearance.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              Establishing a cargo consolidation company in Mombasa, Kenya requires navigating a multi-layered regulatory framework.
              The process involves company incorporation, specialized maritime licensing, cargo consolidation registration,
              insurance compliance, and county-level permitting. While the digitalization of services (through eCitizen and county
              portals) has streamlined many processes, full operational readiness typically requires 6-12 weeks and initial capital
              of KES 1-5 million or more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key success factors include maintaining strict tax compliance, securing appropriate warehouse facilities in both
              export and destination countries, obtaining proper marine cargo insurance, and ensuring staff have necessary
              logistics certifications. Stay informed about regulatory updates, as the sector has seen significant changes in
              2023-2025, particularly regarding insurance requirements and maritime transport operations.
